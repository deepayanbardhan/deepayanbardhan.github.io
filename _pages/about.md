<p style = "font-weight: 400; font-size: 15px;" align="justify">Welcome to my page. I am pursuing Master's in <a href="https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/" style="text-decoration:none;">Electrical and Computer Engineering Department</a> at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/" style="text-decoration:none;">NC State University</a>. I am fascinated by the problems that involves computers taking decisions by themselves including autonomous driving of cars or predication and analysis of data. Using methods of Masked R-CNN how models can significantly improve detection of objects or how using LSTM-CNN network allows to keep track of the past at the same time data series patterns are some of the things that keeps me awed in this field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I always up for a chat if you are a believer that AI is the next big thing.</p>
