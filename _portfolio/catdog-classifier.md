## Brief overview of the project

![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6-brightgreen.svg)    ![Problem Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Problem-Vision-blue.svg)     ![Problem Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data-Kaggle-orange.svg)

The data used has been obtained from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) Kaggle Contest Dataset].

The basic objective of this project is to categorize cats and dogs into 2 different classes. For this I have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to perform the task. The final model used in the notebook file has been used to obtained after some fine parameter tunning to the original model but the architecture of the model has been kept constant.

For details of the code check my Jupyter Notebook File [here](https://github.com/deepayanbardhan/Cat-Dog-Classification/blob/master/CatDog_Classifier.ipynb).

The model achitecture used is:
